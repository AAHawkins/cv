          <p><em>Former RN and Mom Learning to Code</em></p>
          <p>
            I am a former Registered Nurse who worked in the medical field for
            13 years. I worked primarily in psychiatric nursing, but also have
            experience in outpatient surgery. After COVID started, my unit was
            closed, my husband and I got pregnant. Our son was born in 2021.
            Since COVID, I have not wanted to work in the healthcare field any
            longer and was looking for a new career. My husband has always been
            interested in coding and talked me into learning it myself. Now I
            plan to make a career change into Computer Programming.
